we can configure below things--
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  containers:
  - name: my_container
    image: my_image:latest
    imagePullPolicy: "Always"

Then below commands

kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment mycontainer=myimage:latest

kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment mycontainer=myimage

It will actually be triggering the rolling-update but be sure you have also imagePullPolicy: "Always" set.
